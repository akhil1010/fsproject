RICE : The rice plant can grow to 1–1.8 m (3.3–5.9 ft) tall,
 occasionally more depending on the variety and soil fertility.
 It has long, slender leaves 50–100 cm (20–39 in) long and 2–2.5 cm
 (0.79–0.98 in) broad. The small wind-pollinated flowers are produced
 in a branched arching to pendulous inflorescence 30–50 cm (12–20 in) 
long. The edible seed is a grain (caryopsis) 5–12 mm (0.20–0.47 in) long
 and 2–3 mm (0.079–0.118 in) thick.

WHEAT : echnological advances in soil preparation and seed 
placement at planting time, use of crop rotation[clarification needed] 
and fertilizers to improve plant growth, and advances in harvesting methods
 have all combined to promote wheat as a viable crop. When the use of seed 
drills replaced broadcasting sowing of seed in the 18th century, another 
great increase in productivity occurred.
Yields of pure wheat per unit area increased as methods
 of crop rotation were applied to long cultivated land, and the use
 of fertilizers became widespread.

SUGARCANE : Sugarcane cultivation requires a tropical or sub
tropical climate, with a minimum of 60 cm
 (24 in) of annual moisture. It is one of the most efficient 
photosynthesizers in the plant kingdom. It is a C4 plant, able
 to convert up to 1% of incident solar energy int
o biomass.[24] In prime growing regions, such as Mauritius, Dom
inican Republic, Puerto Rico, Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Guyana,
 Ecuador, Cuba, El Salvador, Jamaica, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, 
Philippines, Malaysia, Australia and Hawaii, sugarcane crops can produce over 
15 kg/m2 of cane. Once a major crop of the southeastern region of the United S
tates, sugarcane cultivation has declined there in recent decades, and is now p
rimarily confined to Florida, Louisiana, and South Texas. 
=========================================================================
TOBACCO : After the plants are about 8 inches (20 cm) tall, they are
 transplanted into the fields. Farmers used to have to wait for rainy
 weather to plant. A hole is created in the tilled earth with a tobacco peg,
 either a curved wooden tool or deer antler. After making two holes to the right 
and left, the planter would move forward two feet, select plants
 from his/her bag, and repeat. Various mechanical tobacco planters 
like Bemis, New Idea Setter, and New Holland Transplanter were 
invented in the late 19th and 20th centuries to automate the process:
 making the hole, watering it, guiding the plant in — all in one motion.
 =========================================================================
COTTON : Successful cultivation of cotton requires a long frost-free 
period, plenty of sunshine, and a moderate rainfall, usually from 60 
to 120 cm (24 to 47 in)[citation needed]. Soils usually need to be
 fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be
 exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally 
dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres,
 but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in
 areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. 
Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after 
harvesting the preceding autumn.
=========================================================================
JUTE : The jute plant needs a plain alluvial soil and standing water. 
The suitable climate for growing jute (warm and wet) is offered by the 
monsoon climate, during the monsoon season. Temperatures from 20°C to 40°C
and relative humidity of 70%–80% are favourable for successful cultivation.
Jute requires 5–8 cm of rainfall weekly, and more during the sowing time. Soft
water is necessary for jute production. 
 =========================================================================

MAIZE : Because it is cold-intolerant, in the temperate zones maize must 
be planted in the spring. Its root system is generally shallow, so the plant 
is dependent on soil moisture. As a plant that uses C4 carbon fixation, maize 
is a considerably more water-efficient crop than plants that use C3 carbon
 fixation such as alfalfa and soybeans. Maize is most sensitive to drought 
at the time of silk emergence, when the flowers are ready for pollination.
 In the United States, a good harvest was traditionally predicted if the maize 
was "knee-high by the Fourth of July", although modern hybrids generally exceed 
this growth rate.
=========================================================================
OILSEEDS : Oils may be partially hydrogenated to produce various ingredient oils. 
Lightly hydrogenated oils have very similar physical characteristics to regular
 soy oil, but are more resist
ant to becoming rancid. Margarine oils need to be mostly solid at 32 °C (90 °F) 
so that the margarine does not melt in warm rooms, yet it needs to be completely 
liquid at 37 °C (98 °F), so that it doesn't leave a "lardy" taste in the mouth.
Hardening vegetable oil is done by raising a blend of vegetable oil and a 
catalyst in near-vacuum to very high temperatures, and introducing hydrogen.
 This causes the carbon atoms of the oil to break double-bonds with other
 carbons, each carbon forming a new single-bond with a hydrogen atom. Adding 
these hydrogen atoms to the oil makes it more solid, raises the smoke point, 
and makes the oil more stable. 
=========================================================================
VEGETABLES AND FRUITS : egetables have been part of the human diet from time 
immemorial. Some are staple foods but most are accessory foodstuffs, adding variety 
to meals with their unique flavors and at the same time, adding nutrients necessary 
for health. Some vegetables are perennials but most are annuals and biennials, usually
 harvested within a year of sowing or planting. Whatever system is used for 
growing crops, cultivation follows a similar pattern; preparation of the soil 
by loosening it, removing or burying weeds, and adding organic manures or 
fertilisers; sowing seeds or planting young plants; tending the crop while 
it grows to reduce weed competition, control pests, and provide sufficient water; 
harvesting the crop when it is ready; sorting, storing, and marketing the crop 
or eating it fresh from the ground.

JOWAR : The leading producers of S. bicolor in 2011 were Nigeria (12.6%),
 India (11.2%), Mexico (11.2%), and the United States (10.0%).[7] Sorghum 
grows in a wide range of temperatures, high altitudes, and toxic soils, 
and can recover growth after some drought.[5] It has five features that 
make it one of the most drought-resistant crops:
It has a very large root-to-leaf surface area ratio.
In times of drought, it rolls its leaves to lessen water loss by 
transpiration.
    If drought continues, it goes into dormancy rather than dying.
    Its leaves are protected by a waxy cuticle.
    It uses C4 carbon fixation thus using only a third the amount of water
 that C3 plants require.
=========================================================================
LINSEED :The soils most suitable for flax, besides the alluvial kind, are 
deep loams containing a large proportion of organic matter[42]. Flax is 
often found growing just above the waterline in cranberry bogs. Heavy clays
 are unsuitable, as are soils of a gravelly or dry sandy nature. Farming flax 
requires few fertilizers or pesticides. Within eight weeks of sowing, the plant 
can reach 10–15 cm (3.9–5.9 in) in height and grows several centimeters per day 
under its optimal growth conditions, reaching 70–80 cm (28–31 in) within 50 
days.

CASTOR :  Castor crop requires a hot, dry climate with annual
 rainfall of 500-800 mm, of which 500-600 mm is needed during the
 first 3 months of crop growth. Castor is an ideal crop for marginal
 lands of the Dry Zone where it can be grown under both rainfed and

MILLETS : Millets are generally grown as mixed crops in regions 
of low rainfall, the other crop grown with them being usually 
one of the legumes. Most of the millets grown in our country 
are of short duration, taking, three to four months from sowing
to harvesting. Some of India are sorghum pearl millet and finger millet.

TEA : Tea Cultivation. Tea requires a moderately hot and humid climate.
 Therefore, before cultivating tea in a new area, the suitability of
 the climate is the first point to be considered. Tea grows best 
on well-drained fertile acid soil on high lands.
coffee : Coffee is often intercropped with food crops, such as 
corn, beans, or rice during the first few years of cultivation 
as farmers become familiar with its requirements. ... Of the
